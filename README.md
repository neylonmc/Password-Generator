## User Story

We use passwords every day. Password secruity is important. Instead of using your name or dogs name for your password, this application will allow users to make a unique password to keep their accounts secure.

```
AS an individual, I want to protect my accounts from hackers.
I WANT to be able to have a unique password of random letters, numbers and special characters.
SO I can have faith my accounts are secure and safe.
```
